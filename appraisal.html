    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My learning goal for the AIF project was to improve at the popular game <span class="highlight">Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)</span>, with the clear goal of reaching a Premier (ranked) rating of 10,000 or the Master Guardian rank. I chose this goal because I’ve been playing CS2 for a while and I really enjoyed it, but I really do suck at it. I wanted to use a well thought out structured approach: firstly research, then feedback, and finally practice to turn my casual gaming into a focused skill building journey towards my goal. To achieve this, I knew I could analyse my matches using PureSkill.gg which played a massive role in reaching my goal and seeing where my rough areas were to improve on. The purpose of this final appraisal is to ultimately reflect on the personal and educational value of these learning experiences, and to evaluate the impact of my plan and feedback, and then also reflect on my learning development as seen in my final goal.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="a1">
    <h2>Personal Value of Learning Experiences</h2>
    <p>Arguably the most valuable learning experience during this project was the match analysis, as well as studying pros, and (a lot of) practice. Uploading my first ranked match to PureSkill.gg was, as I expected, very, very useful; All the things such as the death/kill heatmaps, ADR statistics, and breakdown of my utility usage revealed weaknesses I hadn’t noticed, like over peeking way too much and predictable rotations. This really connected to the feedback/improvement relationship my plan had. When I first started this project, I THOUGHT it would be personally rewarding to see gaming (something I enjoyed) used as a structured learning pathway, but oh boy I never want to touch this game again after this. Some people are just so sweaty and tryhard. They need to get a life.</p>
    <p>Watching professional tournaments and highlight reels (such as the 2024 Shanghai event) was another key experience. Taking notes of all the top players demonstrating patience, utility timing, and advanced positioning challenged my assumptions about “good aim being enough. (skill issue)” I have learnt that game sense, decision making, and communication are equally super critical. This insight made me realise how I approach teamwork in CS2, as it can also be quite useful in general with learning the importance of good communication and proper team roles.</p>
    <p>Some games also challenged me emotionally (not kidding, almost borderline insane). There are a LOT of cheaters and just way too skilled opponents with 10+ years of experience that were frustrating, but I tried to take those matches as opportunities to develop resilience in the game and to improve my mindset. I grew confidence by clutching (like an insane 1v4 defuse) and felt my identity shifting from someone who reacts instinctively to someone who plans, reflects, and adapts in the game.</p>
    <p>My combination of analysis, observation, and persistence under lots of pressure gave me practice and the necessary growth in patience, discipline, and communication needed to improve.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="a2">
    <h2>Strategies, Perspectives & Feedback</h2>
    <p>In order to progress toward my goal of 10k, I created and employed several strategies: setting goals for matches, a consistent practice schedule in Aim Lab and in lots of community made workshop maps designed to improve aim and gamesense, and taking notes from the pro games. At the start of the project, I intentionally played matches just as I normally would, which I could then use as a base to see where my most critical mistakes were. Setting goals from my weak points (e.g. “use five pieces of utility correctly” or “maintain 80+ ADR”) turned each match into a practice to reinforce my weak points and improve overall.</p>
    <p>My feedback was very important. I had a friend of mine that was around 18k in premier who mentored me, and advised me tips and tactics such as to slow down T side entries, use utility first, and improve my overall positioning and movement (also taught me Bhopping). Implementing these tactics easily raised my entry success rate and survival per round. He also pointed out my tendency to rotate too early on fake rushes, which caused sites to often go unguarded, which easily gave T side control of the site, often resulting in losing the round. I needed to wait for confirmation before rotating in order to prevent losing those rounds so carelessly. My AIF teacher (Ms Gray) helped me connect my reflections to broader skills; discipline, planning, and resilience which helped me turn setbacks (like games with cheaters!!!) into growth opportunities rather than failures and plain annoyance.</p>
    <p>PureSkill.gg’s analysis also offered a very unique perspective, acting as a sort of coach. As an example, its data revealed that my mid round decision making was far behind my aiming ability in certain maps and games. By rewatching losses and focusing on repositioning, I reduced my dumb careless deaths by around 15% and began winning more clutches.</p>
    <p>The most impactful combination was structured goal-setting plus mentor feedback. When my Premier rating stalled around 4,000, these strategies kept me improving even without immediate rank gains. Playing around with trial & error in simple bot matches also allowed me to safely test smokes and flash timings before risking them in ranked games.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="a3">
    <h2>Learning Development in Output</h2>
    <p>My final output of learning was (supposed) to be a video documenting my progress, featuring gameplay clips, analytical overlays from PureSkill.gg, and reflections on strategies and setbacks. Compared to my early, unstructured matches, the final gameplay showcased tangible improvements: smarter rotations, varied utility timings, controlled recoil under pressure, and more consistent ADR (more than 100 in several games). (BUT MICROSOFT JUST HAD TO CORRUPT IT!!!)</p>
    <p>The video demonstrates my development over time. Early clips show reckless peeks and uncoordinated pushes; later ones highlight disciplined positioning, effective team communication, and well-timed smokes or flashes to isolate duels. My clutch win percentage increased, and several recorded 1v2 and 1v3 situations evidence improved game sense. These changes show progress toward my ultimate goal, even though I only reached a rating of 7k (close though and still progress!).</p>
    <p>If I repeated this project (gosh no), I would start with a more viable goal, and get more feedback from friends, and this time I would definitely not use Microsoft because they suck and are bad, and corrupted all my work. Nonetheless, perchance, the output reflects significant skill growth, resilience, and analysis, all the key indicators of meeting my learning objective.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, this learning journey was somewhat valuable for more than just CS2. While I didn’t reach 10k Premier rating and I still suck, I’ve developed strategies and built a game sense, and also learnt skills that I can transfer into real life. My appraisal states that improvement is not only about outcomes but about the process, and I’ll carry these strategies into future learning as well. As my boy Sun Tzu once said, “Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances”.</p>
